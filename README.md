# VideoStreamCodeTests
Some gstreamer and nnstreamer code tests in C/C++ and python.

nnstreamer_ex1_movenet_tflite.py and nnstreamer_ex2_rtsp_movenet_tflite.py are examples of pose detection using movenet in a gstreamer pipeline. nnstreamer and gstreamer should be installed.

gst_cam_ex1 and gst_rtsp_show_save are samples of gstreamer using webcam and rtsp ip camera.
